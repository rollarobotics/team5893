Autonomous Ramp Plan:

1.Set up Robot for competition.

2.Drive down ramp using gyroscopic sensor and motor encoders.

3.Take IR reading/Score in center goal using gyroscopic sensor and motor encoders.

3.Drive to 60cm rolling goal/Attach/Score using gyroscopic sensor and moter encoders.

4.Drive to Parking Zone using gyroscopic sensor and motor encoders.

5.Release 60 cm rolling goal in Parking Zone.

6.Drive to and knock over Kickstand, using gyroscopic sensor and motor encoders based upon previous IR reading.
