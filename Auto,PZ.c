Autonomous Parking Zone Plan:

1. Set up Robot for competition.

2. Drive towards opposing alliance's Ramp Zone using gyroscopic sensor and motor encoders.
		b. Drive close enough to not enter Ramp Zone, but far enough to not hit the kickstand.

3. Drive towards opposing alliance's Parking Zone using gyroscopic sensor and motor encoders.
		b. Drive close enough to not enter Parking Zone, but far enough to not hit the kickstand.

4. Drive to 30cm rolling goal using gyroscopic sensor and motor encoders, attach to rolling goal/Score.

5. Take IR reading

6. Drive to Parking Zone using gyroscopic sensor and moter encoders.

7. Release 30cm rolling goal.

8. Drive to/Kick Kickstand using gyroscopic sensor and motor encoders.

9. Drive to center goal using gyroscopic sensor and motor encoders, and score.
